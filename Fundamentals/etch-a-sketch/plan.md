# Plan for etch-a-sketch

### The following needs to be done:
- Create an html document
- Have the html document render a 16x16 grid(Research how to make a checkerboard with css)
- Use javascript to create a hover effect on the board

### Nice to have but, not important:
- A red border to create an etch a sketch
- Color changing for each time the square is hovered
- A nicely styled webpage
